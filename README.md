# Roll Ninja

### Introduction

I just flipped a coin and it landed on its edge! I swear on my mother's grave. You don't believe me? Of course not.

Roll Ninja is here for two reasons:

1. Provide a 3rd party random event generator for the Internet.
2. Display the records publicly, so your friends can't f%$* you over.

### Security Policy

If there were a letter before Alpha, we'd use that for this project. This is just a funny toy, and if you have any reason to suspect fowl play, go have fun with your chickens!
